## Major results from our work
**1. Transfer learning improves the performance despite modality difference between datasets**

**2. Squeeze & excitation blocks enhance CNN performance**

**3. Transfer learning with self-supervised methods performs better than supervised model**

**4. Vision transformer performs inferiorly compared with CNN**

**5. Conventional classification (CC)  marginally outperforms the Multiple instance learning (MIL) for exam-level data**
